// TypeScript mock for @hcengineering/platform-rig/profiles/ui/svelte
// This is used in Jest tests to avoid loading the actual Svelte runtime
// which uses ES modules that Jest doesn't handle well by default

// This file is intentionally empty as the import is just for TypeScript definitions
// and doesn't need any runtime behavior in tests
