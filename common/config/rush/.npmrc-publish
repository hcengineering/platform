# This config file is very similar to common/config/rush/.npmrc, except that .npmrc-publish
# is used by the "rush publish" command, as publishing often involves different credentials
# and registries than other operations.
#
# Before invoking the package manager, Rush will copy this file to "common/temp/publish-home/.npmrc"
# and then temporarily map that folder as the "home directory" for the current user account.
# This enables the same settings to apply for each project folder that gets published.  The copied file
# will omit any config lines that reference environment variables that are undefined in that session;
# this avoids problems that would otherwise result due to a missing variable being replaced by
# an empty string.

# * * * SECURITY WARNING * * *
#
# It is NOT recommended to store authentication tokens in a text file on a lab machine, because
# other unrelated processes may be able to read the file.  Also, the file may persist indefinitely,
# for example if the machine loses power.  A safer practice is to pass the token via an
# environment variable, which can be referenced from .npmrc using ${} expansion.  For example:
#
#   //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_AUTH_TOKEN}
#

# Explicitly specify the NPM registry that "rush publish" will use by default:
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Optionally provide an authentication token for the above registry URL (if it is a private registry):
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}

# Change this to "true" if your registry requires authentication for read-only operations:
always-auth=false
