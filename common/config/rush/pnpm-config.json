   * `lib-y@1.2.3`, wheres `highest` will choose 1.8.9, and `time-based` will pick the

   * that the version could have been tested by the maintainer of "lib-x").  For local workspace
   * projects, `time-based` instead works like `lowest-direct`, avoiding upgrades unless
   * they are explicitly requested. Although `time-based` is the most robust option, it may be
   * slightly slower with registries such as npmjs.com that have not implemented an optimization.

   * `highest`, but PNPM reverted this decision in 8.6.12 because it caused confusion for users.
